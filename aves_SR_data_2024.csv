107229,0,One-Marketing-5116,"Time to exercise my first amendment and let the truth fly. I say that first because this is such a ridiculous story in general and I know mirage is going to somehow continue giving me shit for this post as well, but i have time for the truth this morning. I also don?ôt care what they think because you?ôll never catch me in that shithole ever again. So this whole situation stems back from last years Ezoo catastrophe. I think it?ôs fair to also assume everyone?ôs up to date with how that whole weekend was botched beginning to end also. So roughly two months after ezoo, I made a IG page to troll them and mirage. Only took a day or two before the social media manager for mirage noticed one of my posts or comments and I was blocked from all mirage or avants pages. That person then took the time to figure out who ran the page, followed by sending my pic to my very close friend asking ?údo you know this guy?? My friend let me know this happened because at this point he did have some concern that this may become an issue that could have been avoided early on. That is when I DM?ôed the social media manager. I was nothing but apologetic and explained that I was sorry causing any issues and going forward I would not say anything negative in regards to them. I was left on read for weeks, all while I still was going to shows at mirage and sometimes even passing this individual in the artist bar area. Now this is admittedly where I should have done better in handling my words. But after that month of going toMirage with my friends and her coming up to talk with my same close friend, like I don?ôt exist standing right next to him was just disrespectful. So I did try one time to make a face to face apology. I kid you not, the girl said I don?ôt know who you are. I paused, confused for a second and just walked away because her face was saying more than what she was saying it was obvious. I also didn?ôt know if she was about to send the mirage security to kick either but there was definitely some bad energy from this girl and I felt it. Moving forward a few weeks, now we?ôre at elements music festival and I went with 7 people to be exact. Friday was a wash, Saturday and Sunday were great but Saturday is the day that matters. During excisions set at earth stage when I?ôm with my 7 people in the vip area and guess who shows up. The social media manager and her friend walk up to us and just started talking to my one friend. To be honest, I didn?ôt even realize until her friend started shuffling and dancing more In front and towards me. Thats when I looked left at this girl waving her friend to get away from me. I realized what she was doing right away and also realized that this girl was just hella petty. We went from I don?ôt know you to let?ôs walk up to my friend and start up an awkward ass situation. Not once that night did I say anything to her or her friend, I just simply put up with the awkwardness of her being there until they left. That was the one and only time our paths crossed that weekend. Now last night this picks up again at mirage for s2o. Walking in when they first scan your ID, a note popped up on the screen saying contact manager. At first they denied me entry and I asked why. After about a minute, a few security guards had all talked and decided to let me go in. I was inside for roughly 45 mins and didn?ôt move from directly in front of production where my friend and I were taking videos. At that point I was approached by multiple security guards and asked to talk in the back. I ask if I?ôm being kicked out, they say no but also insist we talk outside. And when I say insist I mean 10 massive security guards about to get in my face so of course I go outside to avoid issues. After another 5 mins passes and 10 more guards come to me, the operations manager walks up to me. Now, up to this point I have asked numerous time what?ôs going on and why this is happening. Only one of them would respond saying ?újust wait for the supervisor?? At this point we have gone beyond any professionalism because I did not feel safe around those guards without an explanation and I also let that be known. To say they were intimidating is a massive understatement, they were looking for an issue like thugs. Finally when the operations manager comes, I ask what happened and he told me ?úI was told you made a coworker feel uncomfortable.??I was floored and disagreed and walked away because as he said this, the cops were walking up. Looking back, I should have at least filed a report with them instead of leaving. What did strike me as weird though, was when I was walking away. The operations manager yelled to me to email them and they will fix it. That statement alone still baffles me being they just kicked me out. Overall, I?ôm done with this place. It fucking sucks and this whole experience has been nothing but a nightmare. I can?ôt begin to fathom the fact that this social media manger went out of her way this much and got her way. Congrats girl, you got that. But also, it was never that deep. I just didn?ôt realize soon enough that I was trying to make nice with a not so nice person. But that?ôs what mirage employed and that?ôs the type of energy they put out. I also needed to vent because I don?ôt have shit to hide and the way that place operates is criminal.

You only had to look at the crowd to see why rave was different from anything that had come before at rock concerts and other large scale musical events, where every member of the crowd faced in the same direction. The focus and attention of the entire audience was directed at the stage where it glorified the musicians who performed there. It can be argued that this was actually the purpose of the event to focus 1000s of minds on a small group of people, and in doing so, to elevate them, in the words of Robert Plant, ""to the status of Golden Gods.""     Compare that to the early orbital raves of late 1980s when first 1000s and then 10s of 1000s of kids found their way to outdoor dance parties on the outskirts of London, the crowd point in any direction they damn well please. That original focus: the band on stage, or later, the superstar DJs on an elevated platform, is absent.     Instead, the crowd's focus is turned into itself. It is not on an artist presenting the audience with an experience, but on an audience that is creating its own performance. The crowd are generating rather than observing. The result is that they were not elevating someone like Robert Plant to the status of Golden Gods. They were elevating themselves. It helped to be on the right drugs.     Of course, rave emerged spontaneously, neither planned nor designed. It was a genuine grassroots phenomenon, egalitarian and welcoming. Thousands danced in fields all through the night, out under the moon in order to achieve a trance-like ecstatic state. It was a form of communion, and it was pagan as fuck.     It couldn't last. The press and the government, appalled by such non-violent having of a good time, moved quickly to crush it. Ultimately, though they weren't quick enough.

107368,0,Its_Your_Father,"I went to my first rave festival last night and while I've been to other music festivals this was my first EDM festival. Maybe this stuff is common knowledge to my vets in the scene, or to people who go to a lot of festivals, but I have some observations I can share as I was with some vets and they all seemed oblivious to these guys.I'm always conscious of phone thieves, but being at a rave showed me just how easily you can spot them, and how they operate. 1.) They aren't dressed appropriately. The ones I've spotted were, probably not surprisingly, dressed in far more normal or ""inappropriate"" (lol) attire for an EDM festival. I'm not saying to distrust everyone you see who isn't dressed up, but one had a cowboy hat and a blue button down shirt, and looked totally out of place at the main stage. Another was wearing normal clothes but a hockey mask. Be very cautious of people whose faces are covered, especially in lazy/uncreative ways.2.) They will stand in the crowd looking around like they're trying to find someone, probably with a phone to their ear, using their body to block the view of the people behind them from seeing their free hand probing around in pockets. They may also do this in pairs. One person will block and another will swoop in to do the deed. Be vigilant of people moving between you and your friends. 3.) They're lazy, and looking for easy prey. They aren't going to work very hard to get a phone. They're looking for open pockets like the ones on a denim jacket or loose fitting pants. Camelbacks are attractive due to the few pockets out of sight that can be easily probed with a feel when they ""bump"" into you. If they feel a phone they will then do the ""standing here looking for my friend"" routine, or stage and distraction while they ransack your pockets. Be cautious of loose clothing or pockets out of your line of sight. Be cautious of ""scenes"" that are distracting to many people. Look at the people around when something distracting to many people happens.4.) They are cowards, and if called out will usually either take off through the crowd (especially if they have phones on them) or act oblivious because they may not have succeeded in picking one yet, or they've moved onto phase 3; the handoff. 5.) The handoff; here's how it works. t's important to remember that phone thieves can work alone, but by and large it's a coordinated operation that is planned when the festival is. These losers crawl out of the porta potties they were born in and, for a few days a year, coagulate into a stinking amalgamation and agree to work with other poo-people. The pickers probe the crowd for easy prey, then hand off to the packers. The pickers don't keep more than a few phones on them at once, they hand them off to someone who bulks them and packs them out of the festival. These people are much harder to spot because they have degree of separation from the pickers. They may even go the extra mile and wear clothes that help them blend in, as they are at risk by holding a bag of stolen goods. There are three things you can be sure of, though - they will have a bag, they will have a way to be identified by the pickers( via either appearance or a relatively fixed location) and, most importantly; the pickers will lead you right to them.So here's what you do if you want to be a PLUR hero. 1.) Watch out for the pickers using some of the above information. Watch where their hands are.2.) If you suspect someone is a picker, subtly let the people around you know, but don't alert the picker that you're privy. They are cowards, but cornered cowards can be irrational and dangerous.3.) Follow the picker. If they stop near people for a moment, give those people the heads up to check their pockets, but be careful of pointing out the picker if you're not certain. People could get angry and start a fight and you do NOT want someone to get hurt (especially if you're not certain) nor do you want to blow your cover. There's a higher quest in mind here. Eventually the picker will make their way out of the crowd. Now at this point you may have recruited some allies along the route, but don't pounce too soon. The picker is probably headed for a much bigger fish. They will then lead you right to the packer, if they're part of a coordinated ring. If not you may end up following them around the festival for a long time, but it's worth it. 4.) When they get to the packer you can identify the big fish. This is the one you want. Get their description, take pictures and notify police/security. If you have multiple people with you, one should keep an eye on the packer and another should go get police/security. This is the best case scenario. In the best case they will get busted and the phones will all end up at lost and found. No one gets hurt and the most people get the best possible chance of recovery.If they're alone, follow them until you can flag down a security guard and point them out directly. You can do this if you've followed them for a while and no hand-off has happened. You might miss some sets, or songs, but you will be THAT FUCKING GUY to everyone else.

Recently I discovered the pure ecstasy of Hard Dance music whether it be Hard Trance/Hard Techno/Hardcore/Hardstyle I just can't get enough of that shit. My area (Baltimore/DC) is dominated by house music (not rlly a fan of it), Baltimore only has like 2 or 3 shows I'd consider going to but DC is much better for Dubstep/Riddim. But still DC has only 2 hard dance DJ's coming withing the next 6 months.

I'm a basshead so my local rave scene (Baltimore) doesn't have many raves that I'd actually want to go to, it's pretty much all house music. A lotta people talk about DC and it's def better than Baltimore and it's only 40 mins away but I plan on leaving the entire DMV for something new. 

I'm a Rave Baby, I haven't even been to my 1st show yet plus I'm still exploring all of the EDM Genres but the I know for sure that my favorites are Dubstep & Riddim the most but also like psytrance and acid techno depending on the DJ. 

I could definitely see myself going to local raves almost every weekend if it's the right genre + the right DJ, but I'm not sure which city has a scene like this? ",1/15/2024 4:30,1705311022,40,,,

On day 1 when I was walking from the back left to the back right (just in front of the stands) I got my phone pickpocketed by a group of 3 people. 2 Asian males and 1 Asian female, were all about 5'6 and the 2 males had very short hair (close to buzzed) and were fairly tan. I am also Asian in case it mattered hahaha. They were dressed very ordinarily and seemed very out of place in a rave environment. This caught my attention but I didn't think much of it until I walked past them.

My boyfriend and I aren?ôt super huge bass heads, but we love Seattle and wanted to spend time with our friends, so we got a Sunday ticket. The plan for the last 4 months was we would DD Friday and Saturday, they?ôd DD us Sunday.

Our question is, how is making everyone aware that their sober ride for the show/plan for the weekend is changing airing dirty laundry? What part of your actions are you so eager to hide buddy? Their reasoning for him wanting to drive is ?úhe wants his car?? But it?ôd be there. I was going to drive them over, leave his car in the parking lot, then my boyfriend and I were gonna go on dates in Seattle/hang out at the Airbnb. So the guy would have had his car at the venue. But for some reason he simply must drive his car all weekend. The guy has some anger issues and it showed right away. He didn?ôt try to find a resolution with us at all about this, he immediately fell to insults and threats. He wanted to fight my boyfriend. He also proudly boasted that he?ôd wait 1-3 hours in the parking lot before driving home. Which is laughable, because at that point, he?ôs not even the DD, he?ôs just the driver. Any one of them could?ôve sobered up in that time and driven home. But since he simply must have bumps right as the music is ending, he?ôd make everyone in the car wait on him. And make all of them more of a target cause cops could get real curious about why that car is taking so long to leave. His anger issues have us worried about his fianc√©e. We think she has dealt with his anger so much she will let him do whatever. And the two other passengers are her best friend, and the best friend?ôs boyfriend. We think the best friend is dealing with the guy for the girl?ôs sake, and I think the boyfriend is dealing with it all because of his girlfriend. And none of them want the anger turned on them. And quite possibly they really just don?ôt care about their safety/arrest records. The two in our car were sympathetic, and so was the rest of the group once we messaged them, but everyone made it clear they weren?ôt going to say anything against the engaged couple?ôs opinions.

As I stepped into the venue, I was immediately hooked by the vibrant energy pulsating through the air. People were adorned in the most incredible costumes, covered head to toe in colorful Kandi, and dancing like there was no tomorrow. It was a sight to behold!But what truly touched my heart was the sense of unity and inclusivity that permeated the entire event. There were people from all walks of life, coming together under one roof to simply enjoy the music and each other's company. And let me tell you, that's what truly resonated with me and captured my soul.Speaking of music, it was none other than Zedd who served as my gateway to EDM. I vividly remember the moment I first heard his album ""Clarity"" and his electrifying single ""Stay the Night"" featuring the incredible Hayley Williams. It was as if the music spoke directly to my soul, igniting a passion for EDM that continues to burn brightly within me.Since then, my love affair with EDM and the rave community has only deepened.

107877,0,sochillbill,,1al0flu,aves,The REAL Reason I Want To Rave,"I know a lot of people here rave due their love of EDM music and I must admit that it is damn good music that I listen to daily. BUT, to be completely honest the music is not what hooked me into the scene. I was doing security at Moonrise and me and my coworkers were blown away at all of the outfits that we had seen that night, one coworker explained that festivals like this are the ones where some folks wait all year to go to because they finally have the opportunity to be their true selves with out the burden of being judged. 

And as an Autistic guy who has been relentlessly bullied for YEARS on end by 'friends' and 'family members'  just for being who I am, what my coworker said really hit home with me.

After my shift was over I immersed myself in rave culture, I didn't even listen to EDM before this but I quickly became obsessed with the music. I discovered PLUR which confirmed everything that my coworker said to me about raves. I know raving may not solve my social problems but it doesn't have to, I've just been searching for a safe space for a really long time and it feels like I've found it.  

At another event I did security at a fellow raver randomly walked up to me and asked me to dance, I accepted his offer and threw the fuck down as if no one was watching, no one judged me or my lack of dancing skills, in that moment I hadn't felt so much peace since I don't know when, I even made friends with the guy I danced with (before this I always assumed that I'd hate parties).

Being that I'm autistic and awkward I always look at socializing like a chess match but in rave environments mingling with people is soooo fucking easy lol. I haven't had a social life in 4 years and this feels like a decent opportunity for me to create a new one. If I didn't come down with a months long illness I'm still dealing with I'd probably be raving damn near every weekend, I can't wait to get better because watching festival sets aren't scratching my itch anymore :)",2/7/2024 6:02,1707303747,928,,,

I've only been to raves as a security guard at insomniac events/fests but my experience with event security is what hooked me into EDM Music. I started off thinking that dubstep was the end all be all to EDM music, but I natural have an open mind and ended up stumbling onto a plethora of genres I enjoy just as much as dubstep. 

Even though Big Room is one of my stand outs I only know of one one DJ who is considered Big Room (KSHMR) and on top of that my local scene is pretty much ALL deep house so I'm at my whit's end lol. So with all that said, what are your Top 5/10 (live) Big Room DJ's?

We are planning to go to some raves together, but not all. I have yet to go to a rave.Recently, we had a conversation about boundaries. I made it clear that I want him to enjoy himself when he goes to raves, but as someone who doesn't know the scene at all (none of my friends rave), I am unsure of what reasonable boundaries are. Personally, I am also the type of person who dislikes physical contact with anyone I don't know. I don't hold him to that standard, I mention it because I am genuinely unsure of what is normal at raves. For example, I would feel uncomfortable if he held hands with a girl on a stroll around town, but it seems reasonable if he were to hold hands while exchanging kandi or dancing.

I tried not to let it hurt my vibe, we moved to a different location just in case, and warned the girls and guys around us to watch out. We did manage to tell security after we moved. Then a group of guys start aggressively pushing and shoving saying they want to get to the mosh pit, which was on the other side of the pit. One of the guys pushed me over onto the floor during this exchange. I didn't mind being part of the wall for the mosh pit they formed but the people around me were not having it. The pit was cramped with two mosh pits, which I don't mind, but they kept trying to increase the mosh pit size causing people to start getting paranoid and antsy about their personal space. By the time Subtronics even came on, the people we were vibing with before were gone. They told us they weren't feeling plur in the pit. They were right. We moved out of the pit shortly after and vibed elsewhere. Overall, the show was amazing. The sets were fantastic. The crowd was not. My boyfriend and I felt on edge for most of the show.

What has been your experience at shows, raves, or festivals with ADHD medication in your system?  Do you prefer it with or without medication and why?

While I've had this ailement my whole life I didn't start meds until just recently at 34 years old.  So far only generic Adderall (10mg 2X per day). I'm still adjusting and learning. It's been very helpful and I'm more optimistic about the future. :)

I recently went to my favorite venue surrounded by most of my friends with great music where I'd normally have a fabulous time. However this time I was on the tail end of the medication still in my system. ...and I just couldn't relax or have fun.  I felt out of place. The place that felt like a second home felt like an alien planet.  I was having intrusive negative insecure thoughts.  The joy was gone. This has never happened to me before.

Does anyone else have this experience? Does the type of medication make a difference for this scenario?

I'm trying to decide if I should do this more to learn and adapt or just make sure it's not in my system when I want to do anything...fun. I also understand we should take tolerance breaks so it makes sense to have that break.

Your experienced input is greatly appreciated!  Thanks for reading!",2/24/2024 13:45,1708800325,3,,,

108123,0,Short-and-paranoid,,1b1mqb6,aves,Crime rates at raves,"TLDR - Is the music scene becoming more dangerous and seedy or am I imagining things?


Does anybody know where I can find statistics showing the crime rate at festivals and raves compared with eg a city centre or night club? I?ôm finding myself falling out of love with the scene and I want to hear peoples opinions.

If I was to listen to my heart right now I would be walking away from my main passion and becoming a loner, my friends all have partners now and going to these places are our only real opportunities to get together anymore. I also love to meet new people. Outside of these places I?ôm awkward and don?ôt seem to fit in anywhere, music and dance is my favourite way to connect.

The past few years I?ôve become more aware of the shitty things that go on at these places and I?ôm not sure whether they are becoming more targeted for criminals or whether I?ôm just getting old and noticing the seedy side more as my own perceptions in life change. I?ôd be interested to try and find some facts but not sure where to start looking.

I feel like my heart is telling me these are no longer healthy places and I?ôm kind of wanting someone to prove me wrong.

Any advice would be appreciated. Many thanks ?ôÇ",2/27/2024 15:54,1709067272,0,,,

I get they didn't get the tickets to the event (which I'm happy to transfer at anytime) but I also could have gotten rid of them to someone else by now if I hadn't been holding them up for this person. Does this sound sketchy? If they hit me with the fact they want a refund, what do I do? Advice is appreciated. Thank you!",3/18/2024 13:16,,,,,

108457,0,TurboBanned,,1bn4tvx,aves,About raving blindfolded?,"Like i will get downvoted to oblivion for this because this is super incel-ish behavior but here we go.

Last night i went to a party, none of my friends came, which they said thet would, but that was not that important because i am used to going alone.

The issue is that i am a super horny guy and not very attractive, so i try to limit both my hopes and my interactions with women at all costs, including drug abuse (mainly benzodizepinics), just so i can turn my sex braim off, other than standing in front row and just away from gazing at the girls.

Raving is the only hobby i ever liked besides rotting at home playing videogames, so i really don't want to stop going.

I tried having GF in the past but i hated it, i don't like being bound to a single person.

What actually happened last night is that i met a friend, and a girl started dancing with me, a spark of hope appeared tragically, the moment i sat down, one of her friends said ""hey your friend is kinda cute"".

So after a few seconds i got up and said ""hey let's help each other, you talk the girl i want up, and i help you with this one""?

He said sure, but he is incredibly shy, and even with the girl talking very close to his face he didn't get it at all, then i intervened, talked very close to his girl face and feignted a kiss, she obviously refused, but i just told him ""see, it's that easy"".

But then he basically forgot his part of the deal entirely, and the other black girl stopped being nice to me because he likely told her that i liked her in a corny way.

Then TO TOP IT OFF, he took us to his girl apartment, and while they were going to his country home, he dropped me and the girl i liked in the metro.

SHE DIDN'T EVEN WAIT FOR ME TO BUY TICKETS, SHE JUST RAN OFF.

I spent my trip back so visibly fucked up that even the religious people took notice (i hate them tbh).

They couldn't give me what i wanted.

Worst part is the only girl who gave me a bit of attention, was a fucking hooker, that was so insulting i just got up and didn't talk to her anymore.

Like i must be just that fugly, which is why even tho I LITERALLY TRY TO PSYCH MY BRAIN UP to no think about anything sexual, eventually the million girls in short clothing and the music/dance itself being sexuallize doesn't help.

I am seriously considering doing blindfolds on the raves/clubs, like it is just me, the music, and no horniness to fuck me up.",3/25/2024 0:15,1711340124,0,,,

I have always been fascinated by the illegal rave scene in my country, mostly due to the progressive and libertarian/anarchist political ideas associated with them, but I never really had a chance to visit one.Today I had the chance to do it with another friend of mine... AND IT WAS AMAZING.I have NEVER felt so free in my life. EVERYONE was extremely peaceful and relaxed, having fun, dancing and not bothering strangers. The only interactions I had were people asking for drgs (in an extremely polite and chill way lol) or literally smiling and saying hello. I have a bit of Social Anxiety (who doesn't these days) and at the rave I wasn't feeling judged at all. In a spur of excitement I asked a random dude for a little puff out of his joint, AND HE LITERALLY GAVE ME HALF OF IT. AND THE WEED WAS GOOD.This was already good enough for me and my friend...

I have always been fascinated by the illegal rave scene in my country, mostly due to the progressive and libertarian/anarchist political ideas associated with them, but I never really had a chance to visit one.Today I had the chance to do it with another friend of mine... AND IT WAS AMAZING.I have NEVER felt so free in my life. EVERYONE was extremely peaceful and relaxed, having fun, dancing and not bothering strangers. The only interactions I had were people asking for drgs (in an extremely polite and chill way lol) or literally smiling and saying hello. I have a bit of Social Anxiety (who doesn't these days) and at the rave I wasn't feeling judged at all. In a spur of excitement I asked a random dude for a little puff out of his joint, AND HE LITERALLY GAVE ME HALF OF IT. AND THE WEED WAS GOOD.This was already good enough for me and my friend...

It isn?ôt even necessarily from the substances, I encounter this in day to day life??

Now that I cant mask my weirdness on jobs I only 1 friend I rarely see, get continually bullied out of jobs/forced to quit due to bullying, all of this shit just made me feel that I'd never have the life I wanted.......

Crazy costumes galore, people from all walks of life of all shapes and sizes are flooding into the event that (at the time) was blasting these some hard jams I literally found out to be EDM music. I was so amazed but at the same time confused at the atmosphere and so I asked my coworker ""So what is all of this about"" and also why were there so many costumes lol.

He told me all about PLUR, he told me there is ZERO judgment at events like these, that people who are socially awkward become social butterflies once they hit the gets, he said that people wait the entire year for events like this because it's one of the only opportunities they have to be there true selves. We he told me this I was HOOKED instantly.

I'm gonna be completely honest immediately started looking at raving as a fix for my social struggles, I felt as if I'd probably meet my best friends and finally find real acceptance at a rave after hearing my coworker talk about PLUR. But I know that is still probably far fetched especially since Raving want magically take away my lack of social skills. Plus things don't even go that way for lots of normal ppl. But my loneliness and isolation has gotten to the point of me being severely depressed and even having suicidal ideations due to this shit being a lifelong it's not just a phase.

I won't lie man I'm becoming desperate to socialize and have a life again and raving at least can help me do that.

He told me all about PLUR, he told me there is ZERO judgment at events like these, that people who are socially awkward become social butterflies once they hit the gets, he said that people wait the entire year for events like this because it's one of the only opportunities they have to be there true selves.

Every now and then, we get people who enjoy the oldschool energy & vibes, wanting to discuss or mention how your average rave has changed over the years and (in their opinion) lost some of the original energy and spirit. I can be one of these people. [prepares for rocks to get thrown at me]. 

Usually when this happens, they?ôre jumped-on and drowned-out by a bunch of snarky replies from people who enjoy the modern vibe. 

Here?ôs a thought: you?ôre not going to change their opinion by ganging-up and being snarky. And they?ôre (probably) not going to change your opinion on what you like. So why even bother with them? 

Let them discuss and network with like-minded ravers; simply ignore their posts, go about your business, and focus on what *you* like, with people who are like-minded to *you*. 

Not to be all ?úPLUR??this and ?úPLUR??that, but exercise some ?úPLUR??when it comes to people having a different opinion than you, and possibly not liking what you like. Unless they?ôre attacking you directly, leave them alone and let them have their discussions with their people.

The modern festivals, shows, clubs etc??that you like aren?ôt going to get canceled just because some people on Reddit are posting ?úbring back the oldschool?? But maybe the people who feel this way can network with each other & find/start things that *they* enjoy, if they aren?ôt mocked, ganged-up on and drowned-out by bratty replies simply because they don?ôt follow the norm. 

Just because they put-down the modern stuff doesn?ôt mean they?ôre putting *you* down. They can dislike what you?ôre doing. They can have preferences.

*Just ignore them.*

Raves were still highly underground affairs with the same thousand or two ravers at most events.

Thee was one absolutely adorable girl that appeared at most of them and she danced like a guiding spirit, the type of soul while you've never met, upon first sight you immediately just know you could spend an entire winter wrapped up in blankets with hot chocolate with them...

She was my good luck charm. If I saw her at an event, I knew it would be fire. Here and there we'd make eye contact while dancing our sweaty asses off with nod and a grin- yet we never spoke. This went on for two years.

One Sunday morning at the End Up's afterparties' tea dance, we ended up on the floor next to each other. She was wearing a large, flowy bright yellow vinyl outfit and I was on 250mgs of solid Dutch facekicker, and I did it-

I spoke to her.

I told her she was my 'good luck charm'. She grinned and told me she'd always scan the venues for me as well! I apologized for not introducing myself for all that time and for the first time we danced together. It was as if we'd been dancing together for years- because in a way, we had. We didn't speak after that, just danced for the next two hours as a circle opened around us. Finally,one of her friends came to collect her. She kissed my cheek, told me she couldn't wait to dance with me next time.

109376,0,ponysniper2,"This is the 3rd year of day trip and somehow, they managed to make it worse after great improvements from year 2 over year 1. Ive defended Pasquale in the past given how much ive seen him pre-pandemic put effort into making raves safer (bought out and improved hard summer after 3 deaths to heatstroke, created oasis, has ground control, ect....), has made events funner! (Upping decorations/production, collabs with fun brands, increasing the frequency of events, and just random stuff through out all raves like massages or little dance battles for prizes, ect...)But post pandemic, insomniac has clearly gone the profits first corporate route and it's getting to gross levels. People will say that it's been like that for years, but i feel like its been a gradual decrease over the years since the pandemic. It all started when i started to notice events being blatantly oversold because the company wanted to make up for lost profits during the pandemic. And that theme has continued till today since they noticed people are still going regardless of it happening. Then I've noticed events getting cut. The bay area had way more insomniac festivals pre-pandemic. And they've slowly cut them over time. Even so-cal dreamstate has now been subjected to just an indoor building when it used to take up the whole NOS. I get music tastes change, but it cant be that drastic, especially when you consider the rave scene has only grown over the years. Now as of recently, it has become abundantly obvious that Pasquale and the insomniac team is forcing us to all buy water instead of providing water stations. How are festivals supposed to thrive safely with two water station for the whole festival? Hard summer last year was a shit show for water because of the lack of number of water stations. Edc this year had 2 fucking  water stations for the whole fucking venue. 2!!!!!!!! You shouldnt have to get VIP to get access to water at a reasonable convenience. Nor pay 7 dollars every time you get thirsty. The heat is ganna lead to issues down the line when you pair it with the oversoldness. The only reason i see why deaths and heat strokes havent been a thing like in previous years is because people roll less now given the fentanyl epidemic tainting pills. Also, people don't get as fucked up as they used to. The new generation of ravers are much more tame and responsible in that regard. Regardless, the core issues of lack of water and oversoldness still apply.Next up is security. Idk if people have noticed it, but i feel like the quality and attentiveness of security checks at all festivals has drastically decreased. No one cares. It's just a quick in and out. I understand they are only looking for guns and knifes at this point. But I guarantee you someone could sneak that stuff in if they wanted to given how insanely relaxed security checks are now. And i think part of that reason is because events are so oversold, that security are forced to push everyone so quickly so as to not cause a massive delay when coming in like we've experienced in the past pre-pandemic years. While everything has been safe thankfully so far, i dont like the feeling of this one bit and wouldnt be surprised if dangerous incidents happen in the future because of it. Lastly, lets talk day trip. Anyone notice how 2 day tickets jumped up to like $350+ on the official website? I had bought the black friday sale for like $130, so i was safe. But how the fuck does insomniac have the self respect to bump up the ticket prices by almost 3 times the amount i paid lmfao. That shit is insane. I can see them trying to pull this off in the future as they get more profit out of it. So id say, keep an eye on this. Yes ticket increases happen after phases of time pass, but price increases are like $10-20 dollar increases after each phase for like 3-5 phases. Not literally doubling the fucking price on tickets lmfao.Still on day trip, i think the venue is clearly too small for the event and its felt that way for 3 years now. Its a beautiful venue and i love it, but sell it at a reasonable capacity or logistically plan it better. They reduced the size for one of the two main stages this year, and it was clearly felt as everyone was at mainstage and made that stage feel unbearable to be at. The deep end stage had so few people both days through out the days, it really just felt like a throwaway stage. Logistically, plan things better. Put big headliners at each stage at the same time to divide the crowds instead of just giving one stage all the big names and making it unbearable. Also, can we talk about how we lost two headliners this year last minute???? MK and Armin Van Buuren are two huge dj's i paid and wanted to see badly. Then poof, no longer playing without any warning. That was some straight up bullshit.The afterparty for day trip are amazing!!! I liked it more than the actual festival and feel like insomniac should do more of that. Pasquale was there Sunday night too which was cool. Wish i could have pulled him to the side and told him everything in this post lol. But alas, i'll end my rent here. Im sure ive missed other big things so please chime in your thoughts on all this.

Ive written this out quickly since im packing up to drive back home, but felt like i needed to write it out since it sucks seeing these festivals i love degrade over time. ",6/24/2024 17:02,,,,,

I'm a bit socially awkward and shy. What are some good ways of meeting people and making friends in the rave scene?* I don't know much about raving. What sort of genre of rave should I start with? How do I find raves? I don't want to give too much away but I live in a major Australian city so hopefully that helps.  ",6/23/2024 4:08,,,,,

109511,0,electraus_,,1drr7gl,aves,What would you put in a cute safety-themed bday gift for a newish raver?,"A really close friend of mine is a VERY frequent raver at this point and goes to just about every event, show, and festival near him, which I?ôm happy he found something he likes this much, but what I?ôm not happy about is that I recently found out that the idiot doesn?ôt use ear plugs. Like ever ?ôÉ I?ôm not even in the rave scene and even I know how badly this can fuck up your hearing . His birthday is coming up and we?ôre gonna go to a show together so I wanted to put together a little rave kit as his gift, starting with these: https://a.co/d/035hgKNZ but I don?ôt know what else to include in the gift because I?ôm a very casual/infrequent rave enjoyer. It doesn?ôt even have to be centered on safety per se, I?ôm also open to recommendations for stuff that y?ôall have personally found to be convenient/useful. Thanks in advance :)

I respect boundaries even when rolling. Young people say they enjoy my company. Don't have anyone to join me. Willing to go alone but would prefer to go w others. Should just book it?  Which one? I live in Northern CA. Not trying to appear  younger than I am. Just want to experience the vibe. Don't know what to wear. Any tips and suggestions are much appreciated. 

Edit: I'm overwhelmed by the positive feedback and support. I appreciate all of you.
Fortunately, I'm fit. Surprisingly, I outrun the 20 yr olds in pickup  soccer games several times a week. Was just concerned that I might ruin a vibe, but thanks to your comments, I'm not concerned at all. So I'm definitely going to find one and have some fun.
